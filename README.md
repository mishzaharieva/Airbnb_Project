# Airbnb_Project

## Overview
This project analyzes Airbnb data to predict the price of listings based on various features such as neighborhood, property type, and amenities.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Includes handling missing values, removing outliers, and feature engineering.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and statistical summaries to understand data distributions and correlations.
- **Model Building**: Implementing machine learning models (like regression or ensemble methods) to predict Airbnb listing prices.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assessing model performance using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and R-squared.
